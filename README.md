## Game instructions

At the beginning of a new game the cards are shuffled.  
Two cards are dealt. One to the opponent and one to the player.  
The opponent's card is turned face up, the player's card is turned face down.  
The player must decide whether his card is higher or lower than the opponent's card.  
If the decision is correct the player receives one point.  
Now the next round begins. The opponent and the player receive another card from the deck.  
The game ends when all cards from the deck are dealt.  
  
The ranks of the cards:  
  
Rank (ascending):  
Two, Three, ..., Jack, Queen, King, Ace  
  
Suit (ascending):  
Diamonds, Hearts, Spades, Clubs  
  
Special case: If the opponent's card and the player's card are the same rank, the suit of the cards decides.
